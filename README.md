# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to detect human faces in images and videos using **OpenCV**.  
It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers provided by OpenCV to identify faces in real time.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
Face detection is an important part of many computer vision applications such as:
- Attendance systems  
- Photo tagging  
- Surveillance  
- Humanâ€“computer interaction  

This notebook shows how to:
1. Load images or video streams.  
2. Use OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascade model for face detection.  
3. Draw rectangles around detected faces.  

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Basics of OpenCV and image processing.  
- How Haar Cascade Classifiers work for object detection.  
- How to use a webcam for real-time face detection.  
- Visualizing detection results using bounding boxes.

## ðŸ—‚ Files
- **Face-detection-using-OpenCV.ipynb** â€“ main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations.
